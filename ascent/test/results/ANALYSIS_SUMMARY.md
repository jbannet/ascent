# Persona Test Results Analysis

## Overview
Successfully ran 25 diverse personas through the onboarding flow. The allocation system is working correctly across all user types.

## Protocol Triggers (5 out of 25 personas)
- **fall_history**: 2 personas (elderly_fall_history, multiple_conditions)
- **chair_stand_failure**: 1 persona (cannot_stand_chair)
- **glp1_obesity**: 1 persona (glp1_obesity)
- **extreme_obesity**: 1 persona (extreme_obesity)
- **none**: 20 personas use base calculation

## Key Observations

### Critical Medical Protocols Work Correctly
- Fall history protocol: Balance=35%, Strength=35% ✓
- Chair stand failure: Strength=45%, Balance=25% ✓
- GLP-1 obesity: Cardio=45%, Strength=40% ✓
- Extreme obesity: Cardio=55%, Strength=35% ✓

### Age-Based Patterns
- **Teens/Young adults (16-26)**: Low balance (5-7%), high strength
- **Middle-aged (35-55)**: Balanced allocations, cardio emphasis
- **Seniors (65+)**: Higher balance allocations (12-13%) even without protocols

### Fitness Level Patterns
- **Deconditioned**: High cardio allocation (46%)
- **Athletes**: Balanced allocations based on weaknesses
- **Marathon runner**: High strength (52%) to address weakness
- **Underweight**: Highest strength allocation (50%)

### Health Condition Adaptations
- **Diabetes Type 2**: Moderate cardio focus (44%)
- **Post-surgery**: Balanced approach with some cardio emphasis
- **Postpartum**: High cardio (45%) for weight management

## Distribution Ranges
- **Cardio**: 5% (chair stand) to 55% (extreme obesity)
- **Strength**: 27% (retiree) to 52% (marathon runner)
- **Balance**: 4% (young adults) to 35% (fall history)
- **Functional**: 4% (most) to 25% (chair stand)
- **Flexibility**: 0% (protocols) to 14% (young athlete)

## Validation Points
✅ Protocol priorities work correctly (fall history > chair stand > extreme obesity > GLP-1)
✅ Age-appropriate balance allocations
✅ Fitness level drives appropriate compensations
✅ BMI adjustments applied correctly
✅ No allocation exceeds 100% total
✅ All personas generate valid, realistic distributions

## Recommendations
1. **System is ready**: Allocation logic works correctly across all persona types
2. **Edge cases covered**: Critical medical conditions properly prioritized
3. **Distribution makes sense**: Results align with expected fitness priorities
4. **Expandable**: Easy to add new personas or modify allocation logic

The test suite provides excellent coverage for validating onboarding flow behavior and can be re-run anytime allocation logic changes.
