/// Extension to calculate balance and fall risk metrics.
/// 
/// This extension calculates three critical metrics that work together to create a 
/// comprehensive safety and capability profile for personalizing fitness programs:
/// 
/// ## 1. FALL RISK SCORE (0.0-1.0)
/// Measures probability of falling based on CDC STEADI guidelines.
/// - Previous fall = automatic 1.0 (maximum risk)
/// - Otherwise calculated from age thresholds, gender, and risk factors
/// - 0.0-0.3: Low risk - standard exercises appropriate
/// - 0.3-0.6: Moderate risk - needs balance focus, avoid high-impact
/// - 0.6-1.0: High risk - requires supervised/seated exercises
/// 
/// ## 2. BALANCE CAPACITY (0.3-1.0)
/// Measures actual physical balance ability.
/// - Accounts for age decline (1% per year after 30)
/// - Modified by fitness level and gender
/// - 0.8-1.0: Excellent - can handle dynamic challenges (single-leg work)
/// - 0.6-0.8: Good - standard balance exercises appropriate
/// - Below 0.6: Needs basic stability training first
/// 
/// ## 3. MOBILITY INDEX (0.2-1.0)
/// Measures functional movement capacity and confidence.
/// - Combines physical limitations with psychological factors
/// - Heavily impacted by fall history (-0.4), mobility aids (-0.3), fear (-0.2)
/// - 0.8-1.0: Full range movements, sports training appropriate
/// - 0.4-0.8: Modified exercises, confidence building needed
/// - Below 0.4: Chair-based or rehabilitation focus
/// 
/// ## USAGE IN FITNESS APP:
/// 1. Fall Risk Score is the primary safety gate - if â‰¥0.6, override other metrics
/// 2. Balance Capacity determines exercise complexity you can assign
/// 3. Mobility Index guides movement range and psychological readiness
/// 
/// Example: A 70-year-old with fall history might have:
/// - fallRiskScore=1.0 (maximum due to fall)
/// - balanceCapacity=0.5 (age-related decline)
/// - mobilityIndex=0.3 (low confidence after fall)
/// Result: Seated exercises with gradual balance rehabilitation focus
/// 
/// Based on CDC STEADI Program, WHO Fall Prevention Guidelines.
/// Note: Balance importance is calculated in relative_objective_importance.dart
