fitness_profile_model overview

fitness_profile.dart — central orchestrator
- Accepts onboarding answers, seeds feature map, and triggers every extraction extension.
- Loads/saves feature weights via `LocalStorageService` so scores persist between sessions.
- Exposes the ordered numeric vector (`features`) consumed by downstream plan builders.

fitness_profile_extraction_extensions/
- age_bracket.dart — assigns baseline intensity multipliers from age buckets.
- strength.dart — converts push-up/squat answers into strength feature weights.
- balance.dart — boosts balance & stability dimensions using assessment questions.
- low_impact.dart — raises low-impact preference when injuries or constraints are flagged.
- flexibility.dart — maps stretching/mobility responses into flexibility weightings.
- cardio.dart — scores aerobic capacity and cardio preference from endurance questions.
- weight_management.dart — emphasises calorie burn goals and metabolic focus.
- relative_objective_importance.dart — normalises modality weights into a priority distribution.
- injuries.dart — applies penalties or safety flags based on reported injuries/limitations.

reference_data/
- acsm_cardio_norms.dart — cardio benchmark tables (vo2, run times) used by cardio scorer.
- acsm_pushup_norms.dart — push-up percentile lookup powering strength computations.
- acsm_squat_norms.dart — bodyweight squat benchmarks referenced by strength scorer.
- age_group_utility.dart — helper utilities for age-based lookups across extensions.

Together these files transform raw onboarding responses into the weighted feature vector that the plan generation pipeline consumes.
