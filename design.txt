  Allocation Algorithm

  1. Initialize all objectives at 0%
  2. Add age-based percentages
  3. Add medical condition percentages
  4. Add BMI percentages
  5. Add user goal percentages
  6. Sum total allocations for each objective
  7. Normalize to 100%:
    - Calculate total = sum of all allocations
    - Each final percentage = (objective allocation / total) × 100
