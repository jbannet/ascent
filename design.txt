  - Age 65+ → Balance to Tier 1
  - Age 70+ → Functional to Tier 1
  - Fall history → Balance to Tier 1, Functional gets +50% boost
  - Can't do chair stand → Functional to Tier 1, Strength gets
  +60% boost
  - GLP-1 meds → Strength to Tier 1
  - BMI ≥35 → Cardio to Tier 1

  Exact Allocation Rules

  - Tier 1: 25% minimum each
  - Tier 2: 15% minimum each
  - Tier 3: Split remaining capacity

  Overflow Handling

  - If Tier 1 needs >100% → Divide 100% evenly among Tier 1
  objectives
  - If Tier 1+2 needs >100% → Give Tier 1 their 25%, Tier 2 splits
   remainder
  - Medical needs always override user preferences

  Specific Examples

  75-year-old who fell, can't do chair stand:
  1. Tier 1: Functional (30%), Balance (30%), Strength (25%) = 85%
  2. Tier 2: Flexibility (15%)
  3. Tier 3: Nothing left

  45-year-old on GLP-1, BMI 32, wants weight loss:
  1. Tier 1: Strength (25%), Cardio (25%) = 50%
  2. Tier 2: Weight Loss (15%), Flexibility (15%) = 30%
  3. Tier 3: Balance (10%), Functional (10%) = 20%

  This gives us a complete, implementable framework. Every
  decision point has specific values and the logic flow handles
  all edge cases.

  Is this the level of detail you were looking for? Should we
  refine any specific decision branches further?
