# MANDATORY RULES üõë STOP - MANDATORY CHECKS - DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT THESE üõë
## BEFORE ANY RESPONSE:
  ‚ñ° RUN: context-keeper agent 
  ‚ñ° SAY: "Checked with context-keeper: [result]"
  ‚ñ° MANDATORY: Use ux-ui-designer sub-agent for non-trivial UI changes
  ‚ñ° MANDATORY: Use design-architect sub-agent for medium to large system design decisions 
  ‚ñ° MANDATORY: Use codebase-indexer-qa for any questions or codebase searches and to reindex code after large tasks.
## IF YOU SKIP THESE ‚Üí YOU FAILED
 # INSTANT FAIL CONDITIONS
  ‚ùå Started without context-keeper = FAILED
  ‚ùå Didn't say "Checked with context-keeper:
  [result]" = FAILED
  ‚ùå Used placeholder/temporary code = FAILED
  ‚ùå Guessed instead of checking = FAILED
  ‚ùå Assumed instead of verifying = FAILED
  ‚ùå Didn't check with the ux-ui-designer, design-architect, or codebase-indexer-qa sub agent (if appropriate) = FAILED

  # SPECIFIC RULES 
  ‚úì MUST: Check existing patterns FIRST (find where it was done before)
  ‚úì MUST: Get actual names from code (grep/read, don't assume or make up names)
  ‚ùå NEVER: "// TODO", "// for now", placeholder code
  ‚ùå NEVER: Duplicate code that should be abstracted
  ‚ùå NEVER: Use dynamic or Object types if avoidable. They circumvent type safety.
  
  # THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE FLOW:
  1. Run context-keeper ‚Üí Say "Checked with 
  context-keeper: [agreement]"
  2. Find existing pattern ‚Üí Say "Found pattern 
  at: [file:line]"  
  3. Implement correctly ‚Üí No shortcuts
  4. Verify ‚Üí Say "Confirmed: follows all rules"
## END SPECIFIC RULES 


## SQL/DATABASE GUIDELINES:
MUST: start with INVOKER, SET search_path, fully qualify tables
MUST: prefix parameters with "p_", variables with "v_"  
MUST: use UPSERT for saves
NEVER: use default privileges or guess table names


# PROJECT CONTEXT FILES
Always check these files first to understand the codebase:
- `.codebase-index` - Complete project structure, file organization, and key components
- `.claude-index` - Architectural patterns, feature interactions, and development guidelines
- /Users/jonathanbannet/MyProjects/fitness_app/feature_list - specifies what is a feature in the exercise matrix and profile feature list and what is part of the profile
