TRAINING HIERARCHY

Micro-cycle: The smallest unit, usually about 1 week of workouts

Meso-cycle: A collection of micro-cycles, typically lasting 4-8 weeks

Macro-cycle: The entire long-term training plan, often several months to a year

PURPOSE OF A MESO-CYCLE
It focuses on one main goal (e.g., building strength, improving endurance, fat 
loss, skill work) and organizes training stress so the body can progressively 
adapt. Each week builds on the last, often with increasing intensity or volume, 
followed by a deload week to recover before the next meso-cycle.

EXAMPLE
If someone is training for a 5K race:
• Meso-cycle 1 (6 weeks): base building (easy mileage, technique)
• Meso-cycle 2 (6 weeks): strength and hill work  
• Meso-cycle 3 (6 weeks): speed and race-specific intervals

WHY IT MATTERS
Instead of training randomly, meso-cycles help structure progression, prevent 
plateaus, and reduce risk of overtraining or injury.

------------------------------------------------------

STRENGTH TRAINING MESO-CYCLES

Typical Length: 4-6 weeks (sometimes 8)

Focus: Progressive overload of weight, reps, or volume toward a specific adaptation

EXAMPLES OF GOALS PER MESO-CYCLE:

1. Hypertrophy (muscle size)
   • Higher volume, moderate intensity
   • Example: 4-5 sets of 8-12 reps

2. Strength (maximum force)
   • Lower volume, higher intensity
   • Example: 4-6 sets of 3-6 reps, heavier loads

3. Power (explosiveness)
   • Very high intensity, low reps, fast execution
   • Example: Olympic lifts, jumps, 3-5 reps per set

4. Deload (recovery week)
   • Reduced load/volume to allow adaptation

NOTE: Over the macro-cycle (16-24 weeks), these meso-cycles are sequenced 
to move from size → strength → power.

ENDURANCE TRAINING MESO-CYCLES

Typical Length: 4-8 weeks

Focus: Specific qualities like base fitness, lactate threshold, VO₂max, race pace, 
or tapering

EXAMPLES OF GOALS PER MESO-CYCLE:

1. Base / Aerobic Capacity
   • Easy/moderate runs or rides to build engine
   • Long, steady efforts

2. Strength Endurance / Hills
   • Hill repeats, tempo runs, cycling climbs
   • Builds durability

3. Speed / Interval Work
   • Interval training at or above race pace
   • Example: 6 × 800m at 5K pace

4. Taper
   • Reduced volume leading up to competition
   • Keeps intensity but lowers fatigue

NOTE: Over the macro-cycle, the athlete moves from general → specific → race 
readiness.

KEY DIFFERENCES

• Strength meso-cycles → manipulate load, reps, sets, and rest
• Endurance meso-cycles → manipulate intensity, distance, and recovery
• Both use progressive overload and usually finish with a deload week

Using Macro‑, Meso‑ and Micro‑cycles in Strength, Endurance and Mixed Plans

Periodized training divides a long‑term training plan into cycles of decreasing size: the macrocycle (overall plan), mesocycles (blocks within the plan) and microcycles (weekly/daily rhythm). Each cycle has a specific purpose, and manipulating the variables within these cycles helps athletes progress while avoiding plateaus and overtraining.

1. Definitions and cycle lengths
Cycle	Typical length	Purpose (general)	Evidence & notes
Macrocycle	Several months to 1 year (sometimes multiple years)	The “big picture”—sets the overall goal (e.g. competition season, major event). It includes all training phases (preparation/base, build, peaking/competition and transition/recovery). NASM and ISSA note that macrocycles plan longer periods such as seasons or annual programmes

2. Strength‑focused plans

A strength plan aims to increase absolute or relative strength (force production) and may also address muscle hypertrophy and power. Periodization is used to manipulate intensity, volume, exercise selection, frequency and rest intervals
blog.nasm.org
.

Macrocycle design

Set long‑term goal – e.g. compete in a powerlifting meet, improve maximum squat, or develop general strength. The macrocycle (6–12 months) identifies the event date and works backward
trainingpeaks.com
.

Phases within the macrocycle – a typical strength macrocycle progresses from high‑volume, lower‑intensity work to lower‑volume, high‑intensity work (linear periodization)
issaonline.com
. Common phases include:

Anatomical adaptation/base – high repetitions (10–15 reps) and moderate volume to build connective tissue and correct imbalances
issaonline.com
.

Hypertrophy/accumulation – moderate intensity (60–75 % 1RM) and high volume to increase muscle cross‑section
tonal.com
.

Strength/intensification – intensity increases to 75–90 % 1RM while volume decreases; focus on heavy compound lifts
tonal.com
.

Power/peaking – very heavy loads (85–100 % 1RM) or contrast training to convert strength into explosive power
blog.nasm.org
.

Deload/recovery phase – reduce volume and intensity to allow supercompensation and prepare for the next macrocycle
issaonline.com
.

Competition or testing – after peaking, schedule testing or competition and include recovery transitions before starting a new macrocycle.

Mesocycles and microcycles

Mesocycles last 3–6 weeks, each focusing on a distinct quality—e.g. hypertrophy, maximal strength or power
tonal.com
oliviagallucci.com
. Within each mesocycle, gradually increase intensity or volume for 2–3 weeks followed by a deload week to allow adaptation
trainerroad.com
.

Microcycles (1 week) outline the weekly split. For example:

Hypertrophy microcycle: multiple sessions per muscle group with 3–5 sets of 8–12 reps, moderate intensity, short rest (30–90 s) and varied tempos to build time under tension
blog.nasm.org
.

Strength microcycle: emphasis on compound lifts (squat, deadlift, bench press), 4–6 sets of 3–6 reps at 80–90 % 1RM and longer rest (2–5 min)
blog.nasm.org
.

Power microcycle: plyometrics or Olympic lifts, 3–5 sets of 1–5 reps at high intensity with full recovery
blog.nasm.org
.

Variables and considerations

Intensity and volume: adjust load (% 1RM), reps and sets across cycles. Start with high volume/lower intensity and gradually shift to higher intensity/lower volume
issaonline.com
. Undulating models may vary intensity and volume within a week to target multiple qualities
blog.nasm.org
.

Rest intervals: longer rest periods (2–5 min) support maximal strength and power; shorter rests (30–90 s) increase metabolic stress for hypertrophy
blog.nasm.org
.

Exercise selection: move from general to specific—e.g. begin with unilateral or stability exercises in the base phase, progress to complex multi‑joint lifts and specialized variations as competition approaches
blog.nasm.org
.

Frequency: 2–4 sessions per week per muscle group in early phases; later phases may reduce frequency to allow recovery
blog.nasm.org
.

Deload weeks: include regular recovery microcycles to prevent overtraining; adjust based on training status, age and stress tolerance
trainerroad.com
.

3. Endurance‑focused plans

Endurance plans target aerobic capacity, lactate threshold and race‑specific speed. They manipulate volume, intensity (power/heart‑rate zones), frequency, duration of efforts and recovery.

Macrocycle and phases

Define the event: e.g. a marathon, cycling race, triathlon. The macrocycle spans from the start of structured training to the event (often 6 months to a year). A typical endurance macrocycle is divided into Base, Build and Specialty phases
trainerroad.com
.

Base phase: builds aerobic capacity and muscular endurance. It may involve high‑volume, low‑intensity sessions (long runs/rides) or time‑efficient sweet‑spot training at ~65–85 % FTP for cyclists
trainerroad.com
. Mesocycles within the base phase last around six weeks
trainerroad.com
.

Build phase: increases intensity with event‑specific workouts such as hill repeats, tempo runs or threshold intervals
trainerroad.com
. Weekly training stress (TSS) may not always increase across mesocycles because different energy systems are targeted
trainerroad.com
.

Specialty (or competition) phase: reduces overall volume while sharpening race‑specific fitness. Intensity peaks through race‑pace or VO₂ max efforts, and a taper is included before competition
trainerroad.com
.

Mesocycles and microcycles

Mesocycles typically last 4–6 weeks; they combine progressive loading microcycles (usually 3 weeks) followed by a recovery week
trainerroad.com
. Each mesocycle has a focus: aerobic base, threshold, VO₂ max, or race‑pace.

Microcycles are usually one week long. They set the rhythm of hard and easy days. For instance, a cyclist’s microcycle might include sweet‑spot workouts on Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday, an endurance ride on Wednesday, threshold intervals on Saturday, and rest on Monday and Friday
trainerroad.com
.

Variables and considerations

Volume and duration: increase total distance or training time gradually (no more than ~10 % per week) to avoid injury and allow adaptation.

Intensity: plan sessions at varied intensities (easy aerobic, tempo, threshold, VO₂ max) to stimulate different energy systems
trainerroad.com
. Use power or heart‑rate zones to prescribe intensity.

Frequency: endurance athletes often train 4–6 days per week; frequency may decrease during recovery microcycles.

Recovery and deload: incorporate recovery weeks or taper periods to absorb training stress and peak for events
trainerroad.com
.

Progressive specificity: as competition nears, shift from general aerobic work to workouts that mimic the race (terrain, pacing, conditions).

4. Mixed or concurrent plans (strength + endurance)

Mixed training (also called concurrent training) seeks to develop strength/power and endurance simultaneously. This is common in combat sports, team sports and hybrid athletes. The key challenge is managing the potential interference effect between strength and endurance adaptations
gcperformancetraining.com
.

Macrocycle strategy

Annual plan with phases: divide the year into macrocycles (off‑season, pre‑season, in‑season) that align with competition schedules
getphysical.com
.

Blend training methods: use training blocks (mesocycles) focused on different qualities within each macrocycle. For example, an off‑season macrocycle might include mesocycles emphasizing concurrent strength and cardio base, skill development, and intensive power training
getphysical.com
.

Skill and sport demands: consider that skill practice often takes priority in mixed sports (e.g. combat sports). Strength and conditioning should support, not detract from, technical training
gcperformancetraining.com
.

Mesocycle and microcycle planning

Mesocycles in concurrent training often last 4–6 weeks. Within each mesocycle, integrate concurrent sessions (combining strength and endurance in the same week) or alternate training blocks (one mesocycle focused on strength, the next on endurance). The Get Physical article suggests using mesocycles to structure concurrent sessions while aligning them with macrocycle goals
getphysical.com
.

Microcycles (1–2 weeks) fine‑tune daily workouts and schedule the order of modalities. Strength and endurance sessions can be separated by at least several hours (or on different days) to minimize interference. A sample weekly microcycle might include strength and conditioning sessions on Monday and Friday, skill sessions on Tuesday and Thursday, cardio on Wednesday, and rest on Sunday
getphysical.com
.

Variables and considerations

Order and timing: scheduling affects interference. Performing strength before endurance in the same session tends to preserve strength adaptations better than the reverse. Alternatively, separate modalities by ≥6 hours or perform them on different days.

Intensity/volume balance: avoid simultaneously high volumes of endurance and heavy strength loads, which can increase fatigue and blunt adaptations
gcperformancetraining.com
. During heavy strength phases, reduce endurance volume; during endurance‑focused phases, maintain strength with lower volume/high intensity lifts.

Recovery management: mixed programs can produce high cumulative fatigue; build regular deload microcycles and monitor biomarkers (heart‑rate variability, perceived exertion) to adjust training.

Sport specificity: in hybrid sports, emphasise skills and energy systems that match competition demands (e.g. repeated sprints, grappling strength). Use targeted strength exercises that have favourable cost–benefit ratios and avoid unnecessary complexity
gcperformancetraining.com
.

Flexibility and adaptation: concurrent training is personal; adjust mesocycle length, exercise selection and intensity based on the athlete’s response, competition schedule and injury history
getphysical.com
.

5. Summary

Strength plans: use macrocycles of several months leading to a goal; sequence mesocycles for hypertrophy, strength and power; microcycles manage weekly splits and deloads. Manipulate intensity (% 1RM), volume (sets/reps), rest and exercise selection. Build from general to specific and include regular deload weeks
issaonline.com
tonal.com
.

Endurance plans: plan macrocycles around events and divide them into base, build and specialty phases; mesocycles (4–6 weeks) progressively increase training stress with recovery weeks; microcycles set weekly rhythms of intervals, endurance sessions and rest. Adjust volume, duration, intensity (zones) and frequency; taper before competition
trainerroad.com
trainerroad.com
.

Mixed plans: combine strength and endurance through periodized blocks. Use macrocycles (off‑season, pre‑season, in‑season) and mesocycles that either integrate concurrent sessions or alternate focuses. Microcycles schedule modalities to minimize interference (e.g. strength before endurance or on separate days). Balance intensity and volume, prioritise sport‑specific skills, and include recovery
getphysical.com
.

By understanding how macro‑, meso‑ and micro‑cycles interact and by adjusting key variables such as intensity, volume, frequency and rest, you can design structured training plans that lead to progressive adaptation, reduce the risk of plateau and peak at the right time for competition or personal goals.
