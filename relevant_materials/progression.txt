“Progression” = the rule for making training harder (or easier) across sessions/weeks. It’s how you move from today’s prescription to the next one. Examples:

Double progression: stay at the same load; increase reps within a range (e.g., 8→12). When you hit the top across sets, add a little load and drop reps back down.

RIR-guided: if you finished with fewer reps in reserve than target (too hard), reduce load next time; if more (too easy), increase load.

%1RM/linear steps: add a fixed % or fixed weight each week.

Deload: planned reduction (e.g., −30–40% volume) after 3–5 hard weeks.

LINEAR, DOUBLE-PROGRESSION, RIR-ANCHORED WORKOUT PROGRAMS

A linear, double-progression, RIR-anchored workout program is a method of 
progressive overload that adjusts intensity and volume based on your actual 
performance. This approach is an advanced form of the classic double progression 
method, using Reps in Reserve (RIR) to automatically regulate your training.

Here is a breakdown of each component:

===============================================================================

LINEAR

In the context of this progression model, "linear" refers to the long-term, 
step-by-step increase in a training variable, usually the weight, over weeks 
or a training block (mesocycle). Unlike a pure linear progression that might 
increase weight every session, this method increases the load only after you 
have met the other progression targets.

DOUBLE PROGRESSION

This is a training method that progresses two variables: reps and weight.

• You work within a specific rep range (e.g., 8-12 reps)
• First, you increase your reps for a set or across all sets at a given weight
• Once you hit the top of the prescribed rep range (e.g., all sets for 12 reps), 
  you increase the weight and drop back to the bottom of the rep range (e.g., 8 reps)

RIR-ANCHORED (OR AUTOREGULATED)

This feature uses Reps in Reserve (RIR) to manage the difficulty, or "effort," 
of your workout.

Reps in Reserve (RIR): A measure of how many more repetitions you could perform 
before reaching technical failure. For example, 2 RIR means you could have done 
two more reps with good form.

Anchoring with RIR: Instead of simply hitting a rep target, each set is performed 
at a pre-determined RIR. For example, a workout might be programmed as "3 sets 
of 8-12 reps at 2 RIR". This provides a constant effort level, allowing for 
natural, day-to-day fluctuations in strength.

HOW THE THREE COMPONENTS WORK TOGETHER

The model combines these three elements to create a dynamic progression that 
adjusts to your body's readiness for each workout.

A TYPICAL TRAINING BLOCK MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS:

1. Prescribe a range: You select a rep range (e.g., 8-12) and a target RIR 
   (e.g., 2 RIR) for a specific lift

2. Begin progression:
   • Week 1: You pick a weight that feels like 2 RIR and get 8 reps. Your 
     performance might be 100 lbs x 8 reps @ 2 RIR
   • Week 2: Using the same weight, you try to get more reps while maintaining 
     the 2 RIR effort level. Your performance might be 100 lbs x 10 reps @ 2 RIR

3. Linear progression trigger: Once you hit the top of the rep range across all 
   sets at the target RIR, it's time to increase the weight
   • Week 3: You get 100 lbs x 12 reps @ 2 RIR
   • Week 4: You increase the weight, and your reps drop back down. Your 
     performance might be 105 lbs x 8 reps @ 2 RIR

4. Repeat: You repeat this cycle, using your RIR feedback to guide your progress 
   with both reps and weight

This strategy ensures that you are constantly challenging your muscles, even on 
days when you feel less prepared, while avoiding the plateaus that can occur 
with stricter linear progression models.
