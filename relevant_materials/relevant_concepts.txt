RELEVANT FITNESS PROGRAM CONCEPTS

When building a fitness program, periodization (macro-, meso- and micro-cycles) 
is only part of the picture. Several other evidence-based concepts help ensure 
that training drives adaptations while managing fatigue and injury risk. Below 
is an overview of key principles and variables to consider.

===============================================================================

PHYSIOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES

SPECIFICITY (SAID)
Training adaptations are specific to the activity performed. Programs should be 
designed around the client's goals – for example, someone preparing for an 
obstacle-course race should practise skills that transfer to that event¹. This 
is the essence of the "Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands" (SAID) principle².

PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD
To improve, the body must be challenged beyond its current capacity. Increasing 
variables such as range of motion, volume or intensity over time forces the body 
to adapt³. Without this gradual overload, progress stalls.

VARIATION
To avoid plateau and overuse, training programs should vary intensity, duration, 
volume and other aspects. Adjusting acute variables (e.g., sets, reps, rest) 
prevents plateaus and burnout⁴.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
People respond differently to training due to genetics and lifestyle. There is 
no one-size-fits-all program and results diminish over time as individuals 
approach their genetic potential⁵. Programs should therefore be customised and 
modified when progress slows.

REVERSIBILITY/DETRAINING
Gains are lost when training stops. The "use it or lose it" principle warns 
that stopping physical activity for two weeks or more leads to detraining⁶; 
reduced training leads to muscle atrophy and cardiovascular decline⁷. However, 
muscle memory allows previously trained individuals to regain strength more 
quickly⁸.

ADAPTABILITY
The body adjusts to new stimuli over time. Starting a new exercise (e.g., a 
runner taking up swimming) is initially challenging but becomes easier as the 
body adapts⁹. This underpins the need to gradually progress training to encourage 
continued adaptation.

RECOVERY AND REST
Adaptation occurs during recovery, not during the workout. Adequate sleep, 
nutrition and rest days allow tissues to repair and reduce illness risk. 
Designated rest weeks (e.g., three weeks of training followed by one week off) 
help the immune system and improve performance¹⁰. Dynamic stretching and gentle 
activity aid recovery¹¹ and overtraining suppresses immune function¹².

GENERAL ADAPTATION SYNDROME (GAS)
Training is a stressor; the body goes through stages of alarm, resistance and 
exhaustion. A sufficient stimulus causes an initial drop in performance (alarm), 
followed by super-compensation (resistance) and, if the stress is excessive or 
rest is inadequate, overtraining and illness (exhaustion)¹³. Periodization uses 
this model to plan stress and recovery.

FRAMEWORKS AND VARIABLES FOR PROGRAM DESIGN

FITT PRINCIPLE (FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME AND TYPE)
This framework helps organise how often and how hard to train:

• Frequency: 3-5 sessions per week recommended; more than five provides little 
  additional benefit and increases injury risk¹⁴

• Intensity: Can be low, moderate or vigorous; moderate intensity allows 
  conversation, whereas vigorous intensity limits speech¹⁵

• Time: 20-60 minutes of aerobic exercise per day is suggested, which can be 
  split into ≥10-minute bouts¹⁶

• Type: The chosen activity should be appropriate (e.g., walking, cycling or 
  strength exercises)¹⁷

ACUTE TRAINING VARIABLES
These include type, exercise selection, exercise order, intensity, sets, reps, 
frequency, range of motion, time, tempo, time under tension and rest¹⁸. 
Manipulating these variables allows you to tailor workouts to specific goals 
and manage fatigue¹⁹. For example, compound lifts are generally performed before 
accessory exercises to maximise energy for movements requiring multiple muscles²⁰.

TYPICAL RANGES FOR STRENGTH-TRAINING GOALS
Common guidelines for sets, reps, intensity and rest (starting points; adjust 
based on individual responses):

Goal                    Intensity    Sets    Reps    Rest        Tempo*
                       (% 1RM)
Muscular endurance     ≤67%         1-3     ≥15     30-60 s     4:0:6:0
Hypertrophy (size)     67-85%       3-4     6-12    30-60 s     3:1:3:1
Maximum strength       ≥85%         3-5     1-6     2-5 min     3:0:1:0
Power                  75-90%       3-5     1-5     1-2 min     Fastest 
                                                                controllable

PUTTING IT TOGETHER

An effective fitness plan layers these concepts. Periodization cycles organise 
training over time, but within each cycle you still apply:

• Specificity to match your goal
• Progressive overload to drive adaptation
• Variation to prevent plateaus
• Individualisation to accommodate your needs
• Recovery to consolidate gains

Using the FITT framework and manipulating acute training variables helps 
structure day-to-day sessions. Understanding reversibility and general adaptation 
syndrome reminds you to continue training consistently and to respect recovery 
to avoid overtraining.

By integrating these principles, you can design strength, endurance or mixed 
programs that are both effective and sustainable.
