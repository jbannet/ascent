A linear, double-progression, RIR-anchored workout program is a method of progressive overload that adjusts intensity and volume based on your actual performance. This approach is an advanced form of the classic double progression method, using Reps in Reserve (RIR) to automatically regulate your training. 
Here is a breakdown of each component:
Linear
In the context of this progression model, "linear" refers to the long-term, step-by-step increase in a training variable, usually the weight, over weeks or a training block (mesocycle). Unlike a pure linear progression that might increase weight every session, this method increases the load only after you have met the other progression targets. 
Double progression
This is a training method that progresses two variables: reps and weight. 
You work within a specific rep range (e.g., 8–12 reps).
First, you increase your reps for a set or across all sets at a given weight.
Once you hit the top of the prescribed rep range (e.g., all sets for 12 reps), you increase the weight and drop back to the bottom of the rep range (e.g., 8 reps). 
RIR-anchored (or autoregulated)
This feature uses Reps in Reserve (RIR) to manage the difficulty, or "effort," of your workout. 
Reps in Reserve (RIR): A measure of how many more repetitions you could perform before reaching technical failure. For example, 2 RIR means you could have done two more reps with good form.
Anchoring with RIR: Instead of simply hitting a rep target, each set is performed at a pre-determined RIR. For example, a workout might be programmed as "3 sets of 8–12 reps at 2 RIR". This provides a constant effort level, allowing for natural, day-to-day fluctuations in strength. 
How the three components work together
The model combines these three elements to create a dynamic progression that adjusts to your body's readiness for each workout. 
A typical training block might look like this:
Prescribe a range: You select a rep range (e.g., 8–12) and a target RIR (e.g., 2 RIR) for a specific lift.
Begin progression:
Week 1: You pick a weight that feels like 2 RIR and get 8 reps. Your performance might be 100 lbs x 8 reps @ 2 RIR.
Week 2: Using the same weight, you try to get more reps while maintaining the 2 RIR effort level. Your performance might be 100 lbs x 10 reps @ 2 RIR.
Linear progression trigger: Once you hit the top of the rep range across all sets at the target RIR, it's time to increase the weight.
Week 3: You get 100 lbs x 12 reps @ 2 RIR.
Week 4: You increase the weight, and your reps drop back down. Your performance might be 105 lbs x 8 reps @ 2 RIR.
Repeat: You repeat this cycle, using your RIR feedback to guide your progress with both reps and weight. 
This strategy ensures that you are constantly challenging your muscles, even on days when you feel less prepared, while avoiding the plateaus that can occur with stricter linear progression models.
