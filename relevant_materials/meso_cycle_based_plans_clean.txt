TRAINING HIERARCHY

Micro-cycle: The smallest unit, usually about 1 week of workouts

Meso-cycle: A collection of micro-cycles, typically lasting 4-8 weeks

Macro-cycle: The entire long-term training plan, often several months to a year

PURPOSE OF A MESO-CYCLE
It focuses on one main goal (e.g., building strength, improving endurance, fat 
loss, skill work) and organizes training stress so the body can progressively 
adapt. Each week builds on the last, often with increasing intensity or volume, 
followed by a deload week to recover before the next meso-cycle.

EXAMPLE
If someone is training for a 5K race:
• Meso-cycle 1 (6 weeks): base building (easy mileage, technique)
• Meso-cycle 2 (6 weeks): strength and hill work  
• Meso-cycle 3 (6 weeks): speed and race-specific intervals

WHY IT MATTERS
Instead of training randomly, meso-cycles help structure progression, prevent 
plateaus, and reduce risk of overtraining or injury.

===============================================================================

STRENGTH TRAINING MESO-CYCLES

Typical Length: 4-6 weeks (sometimes 8)

Focus: Progressive overload of weight, reps, or volume toward a specific adaptation

EXAMPLES OF GOALS PER MESO-CYCLE:

1. Hypertrophy (muscle size)
   • Higher volume, moderate intensity
   • Example: 4-5 sets of 8-12 reps

2. Strength (maximum force)
   • Lower volume, higher intensity
   • Example: 4-6 sets of 3-6 reps, heavier loads

3. Power (explosiveness)
   • Very high intensity, low reps, fast execution
   • Example: Olympic lifts, jumps, 3-5 reps per set

4. Deload (recovery week)
   • Reduced load/volume to allow adaptation

NOTE: Over the macro-cycle (16-24 weeks), these meso-cycles are sequenced 
to move from size → strength → power.

ENDURANCE TRAINING MESO-CYCLES

Typical Length: 4-8 weeks

Focus: Specific qualities like base fitness, lactate threshold, VO₂max, race pace, 
or tapering

EXAMPLES OF GOALS PER MESO-CYCLE:

1. Base / Aerobic Capacity
   • Easy/moderate runs or rides to build engine
   • Long, steady efforts

2. Strength Endurance / Hills
   • Hill repeats, tempo runs, cycling climbs
   • Builds durability

3. Speed / Interval Work
   • Interval training at or above race pace
   • Example: 6 × 800m at 5K pace

4. Taper
   • Reduced volume leading up to competition
   • Keeps intensity but lowers fatigue

NOTE: Over the macro-cycle, the athlete moves from general → specific → race 
readiness.

KEY DIFFERENCES

• Strength meso-cycles → manipulate load, reps, sets, and rest
• Endurance meso-cycles → manipulate intensity, distance, and recovery
• Both use progressive overload and usually finish with a deload week

USING MACRO-, MESO- AND MICRO-CYCLES IN STRENGTH, ENDURANCE AND MIXED PLANS

Periodized training divides a long-term training plan into cycles of decreasing 
size: the macrocycle (overall plan), mesocycles (blocks within the plan) and 
microcycles (weekly/daily rhythm). Each cycle has a specific purpose, and 
manipulating the variables within these cycles helps athletes progress while 
avoiding plateaus and overtraining.

1. DEFINITIONS AND CYCLE LENGTHS

MACROCYCLE
• Typical length: Several months to 1 year (sometimes multiple years)
• Purpose: The "big picture"—sets the overall goal (e.g. competition season, 
  major event). It includes all training phases (preparation/base, build, 
  peaking/competition and transition/recovery)
• Notes: Macrocycles provide long-term context: they should be flexible and 
  adapted to the athlete's goals, experience, competition schedule and recovery 
  needs

MESOCYCLE
• Typical length: 3-6 weeks for strength, 4-6 weeks for endurance; can vary 
  from 2 weeks to several months depending on goals
• Purpose: Intermediate blocks that break the macrocycle into goal-focused 
  phases (e.g. hypertrophy, strength, power, base endurance, lactate threshold). 
  Each mesocycle contains progressive loading followed by recovery/de-load to 
  enable adaptation
• Notes: Mesocycles manipulate training variables (intensity, volume, exercise 
  selection, rest, frequency). For endurance, stress is often increased for 
  three weeks followed by a recovery week; strength plans often use 3-6 week 
  phases focusing on hypertrophy, strength or power

MICROCYCLE
• Typical length: Typically 1 week; can be 1-2 weeks for mixed plans
• Purpose: The smallest unit—plans daily or weekly workouts and sets the rhythm 
  (hard vs easy days, rest days). Microcycles adjust intensity and volume 
  day-to-day and are repeated to form mesocycles
• Notes: Microcycles are tailored to recovery and adaptation. In endurance plans, 
  a microcycle might include specific interval days, long rides/runs and rest 
  days. In strength plans, microcycles define the weekly split (e.g. push/pull/
  legs) and vary intensity and volume over days

2. STRENGTH-FOCUSED PLANS

A strength plan aims to increase absolute or relative strength (force production) 
and may also address muscle hypertrophy and power. Periodization is used to 
manipulate intensity, volume, exercise selection, frequency and rest intervals.

MACROCYCLE DESIGN
Set long-term goal – e.g. compete in a powerlifting meet, improve maximum squat, 
or develop general strength. The macrocycle (6-12 months) identifies the event 
date and works backward.

Phases within the macrocycle – a typical strength macrocycle progresses from 
high-volume, lower-intensity work to lower-volume, high-intensity work (linear 
periodization). Common phases include:

• Anatomical adaptation/base – high repetitions (10-15 reps) and moderate volume 
  to build connective tissue and correct imbalances

• Hypertrophy/accumulation – moderate intensity (60-75% 1RM) and high volume to 
  increase muscle cross-section

• Strength/intensification – intensity increases to 75-90% 1RM while volume 
  decreases; focus on heavy compound lifts

• Power/peaking – very heavy loads (85-100% 1RM) or contrast training to convert 
  strength into explosive power

• Deload/recovery phase – reduce volume and intensity to allow supercompensation 
  and prepare for the next macrocycle

• Competition or testing – after peaking, schedule testing or competition and 
  include recovery transitions before starting a new macrocycle

MESOCYCLES AND MICROCYCLES
Mesocycles last 3-6 weeks, each focusing on a distinct quality—e.g. hypertrophy, 
maximal strength or power. Within each mesocycle, gradually increase intensity 
or volume for 2-3 weeks followed by a deload week to allow adaptation.

Microcycles (1 week) outline the weekly split. For example:

• Hypertrophy microcycle: multiple sessions per muscle group with 3-5 sets of 
  8-12 reps, moderate intensity, short rest (30-90 s) and varied tempos to build 
  time under tension

• Strength microcycle: emphasis on compound lifts (squat, deadlift, bench press), 
  4-6 sets of 3-6 reps at 80-90% 1RM and longer rest (2-5 min)

• Power microcycle: plyometrics or Olympic lifts, 3-5 sets of 1-5 reps at high 
  intensity with full recovery

VARIABLES AND CONSIDERATIONS
• Intensity and volume: adjust load (% 1RM), reps and sets across cycles. Start 
  with high volume/lower intensity and gradually shift to higher intensity/lower 
  volume. Undulating models may vary intensity and volume within a week to target 
  multiple qualities

• Rest intervals: longer rest periods (2-5 min) support maximal strength and 
  power; shorter rests (30-90 s) increase metabolic stress for hypertrophy

• Exercise selection: move from general to specific—e.g. begin with unilateral 
  or stability exercises in the base phase, progress to complex multi-joint lifts 
  and specialized variations as competition approaches

• Frequency: 2-4 sessions per week per muscle group in early phases; later phases 
  may reduce frequency to allow recovery

• Deload weeks: include regular recovery microcycles to prevent overtraining; 
  adjust based on training status, age and stress tolerance

3. ENDURANCE-FOCUSED PLANS

Endurance plans target aerobic capacity, lactate threshold and race-specific 
speed. They manipulate volume, intensity (power/heart-rate zones), frequency, 
duration of efforts and recovery.

MACROCYCLE AND PHASES
Define the event: e.g. a marathon, cycling race, triathlon. The macrocycle spans 
from the start of structured training to the event (often 6 months to a year). 
A typical endurance macrocycle is divided into Base, Build and Specialty phases:

• Base phase: builds aerobic capacity and muscular endurance. It may involve 
  high-volume, low-intensity sessions (long runs/rides) or time-efficient 
  sweet-spot training at ~65-85% FTP for cyclists. Mesocycles within the base 
  phase last around six weeks

• Build phase: increases intensity with event-specific workouts such as hill 
  repeats, tempo runs or threshold intervals. Weekly training stress (TSS) may 
  not always increase across mesocycles because different energy systems are 
  targeted

• Specialty (or competition) phase: reduces overall volume while sharpening 
  race-specific fitness. Intensity peaks through race-pace or VO₂ max efforts, 
  and a taper is included before competition

MESOCYCLES AND MICROCYCLES
Mesocycles typically last 4-6 weeks; they combine progressive loading microcycles 
(usually 3 weeks) followed by a recovery week. Each mesocycle has a focus: 
aerobic base, threshold, VO₂ max, or race-pace.

Microcycles are usually one week long. They set the rhythm of hard and easy days. 
For instance, a cyclist's microcycle might include sweet-spot workouts on 
Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday, an endurance ride on Wednesday, threshold intervals on 
Saturday, and rest on Monday and Friday.

VARIABLES AND CONSIDERATIONS
• Volume and duration: increase total distance or training time gradually (no 
  more than ~10% per week) to avoid injury and allow adaptation

• Intensity: plan sessions at varied intensities (easy aerobic, tempo, threshold, 
  VO₂ max) to stimulate different energy systems. Use power or heart-rate zones 
  to prescribe intensity

• Frequency: endurance athletes often train 4-6 days per week; frequency may 
  decrease during recovery microcycles

• Recovery and deload: incorporate recovery weeks or taper periods to absorb 
  training stress and peak for events

• Progressive specificity: as competition nears, shift from general aerobic work 
  to workouts that mimic the race (terrain, pacing, conditions)

4. MIXED OR CONCURRENT PLANS (STRENGTH + ENDURANCE)

Mixed training (also called concurrent training) seeks to develop strength/power 
and endurance simultaneously. This is common in combat sports, team sports and 
hybrid athletes. The key challenge is managing the potential interference effect 
between strength and endurance adaptations.

MACROCYCLE STRATEGY
• Annual plan with phases: divide the year into macrocycles (off-season, 
  pre-season, in-season) that align with competition schedules

• Blend training methods: use training blocks (mesocycles) focused on different 
  qualities within each macrocycle. For example, an off-season macrocycle might 
  include mesocycles emphasizing concurrent strength and cardio base, skill 
  development, and intensive power training

• Skill and sport demands: consider that skill practice often takes priority in 
  mixed sports (e.g. combat sports). Strength and conditioning should support, 
  not detract from, technical training

MESOCYCLE AND MICROCYCLE PLANNING
Mesocycles in concurrent training often last 4-6 weeks. Within each mesocycle, 
integrate concurrent sessions (combining strength and endurance in the same week) 
or alternate training blocks (one mesocycle focused on strength, the next on 
endurance).

Microcycles (1-2 weeks) fine-tune daily workouts and schedule the order of 
modalities. Strength and endurance sessions can be separated by at least several 
hours (or on different days) to minimize interference. A sample weekly microcycle 
might include strength and conditioning sessions on Monday and Friday, skill 
sessions on Tuesday and Thursday, cardio on Wednesday, and rest on Sunday.

VARIABLES AND CONSIDERATIONS
• Order and timing: scheduling affects interference. Performing strength before 
  endurance in the same session tends to preserve strength adaptations better 
  than the reverse. Alternatively, separate modalities by ≥6 hours or perform 
  them on different days

• Intensity/volume balance: avoid simultaneously high volumes of endurance and 
  heavy strength loads, which can increase fatigue and blunt adaptations. During 
  heavy strength phases, reduce endurance volume; during endurance-focused 
  phases, maintain strength with lower volume/high intensity lifts

• Recovery management: mixed programs can produce high cumulative fatigue; build 
  regular deload microcycles and monitor biomarkers (heart-rate variability, 
  perceived exertion) to adjust training

• Sport specificity: in hybrid sports, emphasise skills and energy systems that 
  match competition demands (e.g. repeated sprints, grappling strength). Use 
  targeted strength exercises that have favourable cost–benefit ratios and avoid 
  unnecessary complexity

• Flexibility and adaptation: concurrent training is personal; adjust mesocycle 
  length, exercise selection and intensity based on the athlete's response, 
  competition schedule and injury history

5. SUMMARY

STRENGTH PLANS: Use macrocycles of several months leading to a goal; sequence 
mesocycles for hypertrophy, strength and power; microcycles manage weekly splits 
and deloads. Manipulate intensity (% 1RM), volume (sets/reps), rest and exercise 
selection. Build from general to specific and include regular deload weeks.

ENDURANCE PLANS: Plan macrocycles around events and divide them into base, build 
and specialty phases; mesocycles (4-6 weeks) progressively increase training 
stress with recovery weeks; microcycles set weekly rhythms of intervals, 
endurance sessions and rest. Adjust volume, duration, intensity (zones) and 
frequency; taper before competition.

MIXED PLANS: Combine strength and endurance through periodized blocks. Use 
macrocycles (off-season, pre-season, in-season) and mesocycles that either 
integrate concurrent sessions or alternate focuses. Microcycles schedule 
modalities to minimize interference (e.g. strength before endurance or on 
separate days). Balance intensity and volume, prioritise sport-specific skills, 
and include recovery.

By understanding how macro-, meso- and micro-cycles interact and by adjusting 
key variables such as intensity, volume, frequency and rest, you can design 
structured training plans that lead to progressive adaptation, reduce the risk 
of plateau and peak at the right time for competition or personal goals.
