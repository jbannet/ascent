1. Exercise Progression Pathways

  Cardio Progression (4 levels):
  Level 1: Walk → Level 2: Walk/Jog → Level 3: Jog → Level 4: Sprints/HIIT

  Bodyweight Push Progression (5 levels):
  Level 1: Wall Pushup → Level 2: Incline Pushup → Level 3: Knee Pushup →
  Level 4: Standard Pushup → Level 5: Decline/Single-arm Pushup

  2. Exercise Difficulty Dimensions

  Based on the existing feature matrix system, each exercise progression
  considers:

  - Biomechanical Complexity: Wall pushup (simple) → Standard pushup (complex)
  - Load/Resistance: Bodyweight → Added resistance → External load
  - Range of Motion: Partial → Full → Extended
  - Stability Requirements: Stable surface → Unstable → Single-limb
  - Coordination Demands: Single-plane → Multi-plane movement


  Strength Training Progressions:

  Upper Body Push:
  1. Wall Pushup (assisted)
  2. Incline Pushup (reduced load)
  3. Knee Pushup (modified range)
  4. Standard Pushup (full bodyweight)
  5. Decline Pushup (increased load)
  6. Single-arm/Weighted Pushup (advanced)

  Upper Body Pull:
  1. Assisted Pull-up/Lat Pulldown (machine)
  2. Resistance Band Rows (bands)
  3. Inverted Rows (bodyweight angle)
  4. Assisted Pull-up (bands)
  5. Standard Pull-up (full bodyweight)
  6. Weighted Pull-up (added resistance)

  Lower Body:
  1. Chair-assisted Squats (assistance)
  2. Partial Range Squats (limited ROM)
  3. Bodyweight Squats (full range)
  4. Single-leg Squats (unilateral)
  5. Jump Squats (plyometric)
  6. Weighted Squats (external load)

  Core:
  1. Dead Bug (supine stability)
  2. Plank (isometric hold)
  3. Modified Crunches (basic flexion)
  4. Bicycle Crunches (rotation)
  5. Hanging Leg Raises (advanced)
  6. Dragon Flags (expert level)

  Cardio Training Progressions:

  Steady-State Cardio:
  1. Slow Walk (2-2.5 mph, 40-50% max HR)
  2. Brisk Walk (3-4 mph, 50-60% max HR)
  3. Walk/Jog Intervals (alternating, 60-70% max HR)
  4. Continuous Jog (5-6 mph, 70-80% max HR)
  5. Running (7+ mph, 80-90% max HR)

  HIIT Progressions:
  1. Walking Intervals (walk/fast walk)
  2. Basic Intervals (walk/jog)
  3. Run/Walk Intervals (higher intensity)
  4. Sprint Intervals (near maximal)
  5. Complex HIIT (multi-movement patterns)

  Phase 4: User Interface
  1. Add progression visualization to exercise cards
  2. Show advancement pathways in workout plans
  3. Provide progression tracking and achievement feedback
