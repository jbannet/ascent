## Notes for Implementation:
1. Each recommendation should check multiple related inputs for context
2. Prioritize safety recommendations (fall risk, injuries) highest
3. Age-adjust all recommendations appropriately
4. Consider interaction between multiple conditions
5. Always frame positively - what TO do, not just what to avoid
