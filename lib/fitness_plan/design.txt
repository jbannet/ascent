1. MyJourneyView: My Journey is a summary view. It has four sections that go from bottom to top: Build foundations, Explore motivations, Form habits, Find a passion.
Each of these stages is a section rising. It starts from the bottom where you start to the top with a circle that can be filled in marking it. 
(Note, each is the same widget).

Within each stage of the journey you accumulate badges based on your plan and journey. The journey adapts dynamically.

2. ChallengeSetView: Each day / week there are activities you have to finish and accomplish. These fit into one of five categories: aerobic, strength, diet, sleep, balance.
Not every user has every category. The full set is represented in a card that summarizes what you need to complete for the week or day. 
Each activity can be marked as complete or not.

3. ActivityView: Each activity can be clicked into for more information. The Activity View explains the activity, how to do it, it's purpose, etc.
